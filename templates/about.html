    <!-- What is Themis -->
    <section class="content-section">
        <h2>What is Themis?</h2>
        <p>Themis is a legislative alert system that helps people stay informed about bills and laws that directly
            affect their lives. Every year, thousands of bills pass through state and federal legislatures that impact
            civil rights, healthcare, education, employment, and more—but most people never hear about them until it's
            too late.</p>
        <p>We built Themis to solve this problem. Our platform automatically tracks legislation based on your interests
            and sends you personalized notifications when relevant bills are introduced or passed, with summaries
            written in plain language.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Why This Matters -->
    <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
        <p>Legislative changes can have profound effects on people's daily lives, but tracking this information requires
            constant monitoring of multiple legislative databases, understanding complex legal language, and time that
            most people don't have.</p>
        <p>Women, LGBTQ+ individuals, and other marginalized groups are often disproportionately affected by
            legislation, yet face barriers to civic engagement. Themis removes these barriers by bringing the
            information directly to you.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- How It Works -->
    <section class="content-section">
        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Select Your Interests:</strong> Choose the policy areas that matter to you—reproductive rights,
                healthcare, education, voting access, criminal justice, and more.</li>
            <li><strong>We Track Legislation:</strong> Our system monitors state and federal legislative databases every
                30 minutes, scraping new bills as they're introduced.</li>
            <li><strong>AI Summarization:</strong> Complex legal text is processed through AI to generate plain-language
                summaries and extract relevant policy tags.</li>
            <li><strong>Smart Matching:</strong> Bills are automatically matched to users based on their selected
                interests.</li>
            <li><strong>Get Notified:</strong> You receive push notifications when legislation affecting you is
                introduced or passes, with links to the full text.</li>
        </ol>
    </section>

    <!-- Technology -->
    <section class="content-section">
        <h2>The Technology</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Web scraping:</strong> Collects bills from Indiana's legislative database</li>
            <li><strong>AI/NLP:</strong> Summarizes bills and extracts policy categories</li>
            <li><strong>MongoDB:</strong> Stores bills and user preferences</li>
            <li><strong>Web push notifications:</strong> Real-time alerts</li>
            <li><strong>Flask backend:</strong> Automated scheduling checks for new legislation every 30 minutes</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Why Themis -->
    <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Why "Themis"?</h2>
        <p>In Greek mythology, Themis is the goddess of divine law, order, and justice. She's depicted holding scales,
            symbolizing fairness and balance. Themis had the gift of foresight and served as an advisor on matters of
            justice.</p>
        <p>We chose this name because our platform helps you see what's coming in the legislative landscape and make
            informed decisions about laws that affect you—just like Themis guided the ancient Greeks toward fair and
            just outcomes.</p>

    <!-- Team -->
    <section class="content-section">
        <h2>The Team</h2>
        <p>Themis was created by four students at Purdue University for InnovateHer 2026:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sophia</strong> - Backend & Notifications: Built the Flask server, notification system, and API
                endpoints</li>
            <li><strong>Nathan</strong> - Web Scraping: Developed the scraper that collects bills from legislative
                websites</li>
            <li><strong>Gabe</strong> - AI Processing: Implemented AI summarization and tag extraction</li>
            <li><strong>Madhav</strong> - Database & Orchestration: Designed the MongoDB schema and built the scheduler
            </li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- InnovateHer -->
    <section class="content-section">
        <h2>InnovateHer 2026</h2>
        <p>This project was developed for InnovateHer, Purdue University's hackathon celebrating women and gender
            minorities in technology. The event challenges participants to create solutions that address real-world
            problems affecting underrepresented communities.</p>
        <p>Themis directly aligns with InnovateHer's mission by making civic engagement accessible to people who lack
            resources to track legislation and empowering marginalized groups to stay informed about laws affecting
            their rights.</p>
        <p><strong>Track:</strong> Mind Matters (civic empowerment as mental health/safety)<br>
            <strong>Dates:</strong> February 7-8, 2026<br>
            <strong>Location:</strong> Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN
